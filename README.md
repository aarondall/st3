# Sublime Text 3 & Macaulay2

[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a versatile text editor available for multiple platforms. [Macaulay2](https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2) is open source software for computing with algebraic varieties. These files provide syntax definitions and syntax highlighting for Macaulay2 files (.m2) when working in Sublime Text.

To use these files with a working version of ST3 place `m2syntax.sublime-syntax` into the `Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` folder and `macaulay2.tmTheme` into the `Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/Color\ Schemes` folder. Open a file with the file extension `.m2` (or create one if necessary) and change the color scheme to `macaulay2`.
